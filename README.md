# Homework 8: Making a shiny app

## Link

**Here is [link](https://qinxinlin.shinyapps.io/BCLapp/) of shiny app.**

**Here is [link](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-QinxinLin/blob/master/BCLapp/BCLApp/app.R) of R code**.

## Some features I added:

* filter by country

* filter by type of product

* Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI

* Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table

* Show the number of results found whenever the filters change

* Allow the user to download the results table as a .csv file

## Reflection

* This project is quite interesting since I can put everything I learned from the course into a small app. 

* The process is not very tough but debugging is a little bit time-consuming.
